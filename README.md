Wherebnb is an application that uses machine learning in the backend and provides:

* Tourists with price estimates of a house in any region, based on features they have selected.
* Hosts with popularity estimates of their house if they were to put it up for rent on Airbnb, it also suggests pricing for that house.
* Users with a map of nearby places actually available for rent on Airbnb in the selected region.
* Travellers with a list of nearby experiences in the selected city.
